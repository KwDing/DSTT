And there are various background music pieces for users to choose from for short-form video editing and creation. In this project, we create a top TikTok song dataset. We annotated beat and downbeat time stamps on these songs first, then used this dataset to evaluate two famous beat-tracking platforms: Madmom and Librosa. The results show that the average f-measure score of this dataset is 0.92 and 0.62 on Madmom and Librosa, respectively. We hope that this dataset will be helpful for the research work of the MIR community. The colab notebook could be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gZNCXWFaJWpxMn_TeDP5FNk69dHrWQ5S?usp=sharing).\n","\n","# Dataset Introduction\n","\n","This dataset contains 375 tracks, each one is 30-second long. The data structure of each track is as follows:\n","\n","```\n","{\n","track_id: ‘0000’,\n","audio_path: ‘/content/drive/MyDrive/MIR_final/audio/0000.wav’,\n","rank: ‘1’,\n","song_name: ‘Love You So’,\n","segment: ‘1’\n","times...\n","labels...\n","downbeats...\n","}\n","```\n","\n","We provide a [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1U7J-dDlCob_s_KF5fu5nHbEXKIpCYVVg) to the annotation file, which you can download directly to your Google Drive via the script in the `.ipynb` file with `dataset.download_annotation()`. For copyright considerations, we will not provide the original audio files directly to the user. However, users can download and pre-process the data themselves through `dataset.download_audio()`. Since the downloaded audio is mp3, but most packages in python can’t read mp3 files directly, users need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) on their computers. (ffmpeg is installed by default in colab.)"],"metadata":{"id":"aSeER6T7odoH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Encapsulation of the dataset\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dE0961C3GB2J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install pydub --quiet --exists-action i\n","!pip install madmom --quiet --exists-action i\n","import os\n","import madmom\n","from pydub import AudioSegment\n","import numpy as np\n","import requests\n","import string\n","import pandas as pd\n","import urllib\n","import sys\n","import glob\n","import soundfile as sf\n","import gdown\n","import zipfile"],"metadata":{"id":"_5tyTtGRRJTe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670215118775,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":45583,"user":{"displayName":"Yi Deng","userId":"17007130912411171812"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"23ce85d9-2c56-4508-d1df-1dd8064f243e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting pydub\n","  Downloading pydub-0.25.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (32 kB)\n","Installing collected packages: pydub\n","Successfully installed pydub-0.25.1\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting madmom\n","  Downloading madmom-0.16.1.tar.gz (20.0 MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 20.0 MB 1.5 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.13.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages (from madmom) (1.21.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=0.16 in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages (from madmom) (1.7.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cython>=0.25 in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages (from madmom) (0.29.32)\n","Collecting mido>=1.2.8\n","  Downloading mido-1.2.10-py2.py3-none-any.whl (51 kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 51 kB 7.4 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hBuilding wheels for collected packages: madmom\n","  Building wheel for madmom (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for madmom: filename=madmom-0.16.1-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl size=21153369 sha256=1ff660d873f5888e565ee75af7e2c8ae00d09e3d8ee423b2fd5fcd238c6477e3\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/a2/fc/0f/2d5569ea771ee70a9bf321a72744b4507eb85ff540d82b54eb\n","Successfully built madmom\n","Installing collected packages: mido, madmom\n","Successfully installed madmom-0.16.1 mido-1.2.10\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Track:\n","    def __init__(self, id, path = '.', audio_path = None, annotation_path = None,  rank = '', song_name = '', segment = ''):\n","        self.track_id = id\n","        self.songname = song_name\n","        if audio_path == None:\n","            self.audio_path = path + '/audio/'+id+'.wav'\n","        else:\n","            self.audio_path = path + audio_path\n","        if annotation_path == None:\n","            self.annotation_path = path + '/annotation/'+id+'.txt'\n","        else: \n","            self.annotation_path = path + annotation_path   \n","        self.segment = segment\n","        self.rank = rank\n","        self.song_name = song_name\n","        annotation = np.loadtxt(self.annotation_path)\n","        self.times = annotation[:,0]\n","        self.labels = annotation[:,1]\n","        self.downbeats = [ self.times[i] for i in range(len(self.times)) if self.labels[i] == 1] \n","        \n","    \n","    def __str__(self):\n","        return f\"track_id: {self.track_id},\\naudio_path: {self.audio_path},\\nrank: {self.rank},\\nsong_name: {self.song_name},\\nsegment: {self.segment}\\ntimes...\\nlabels...\\ndownbeats...\"\n","\n","    def audio(self):\n","        '''\n","        Load the audio from the track as mono\n","        '''\n","        y, fs = sf.read(self.audio_path)\n","        if y.ndim > 1:\n","            y = np.mean(y, axis=1)\n","        return y, fs\n","\n","\n","\n","class Dataset:\n","    def __init__(self, home = '.', metadata_path = '/annotation/annotation.csv'):\n","        self.home = home \n","        self.metadata_path = home + metadata_path\n","        self.tracks = None\n","        if not os.path.exists(home): \n","            os.mkdir(home)\n","    \n","    def __str__(self):\n","        if self.tracks == None:\n","            return f\"home: {self.home}, tracks not initialized.
